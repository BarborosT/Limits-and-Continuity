# Limits-and-Continuity

Let's try to understand the concepts of limits and continuity with an intuitive approach. In this page I'll introduce briefly the ideas behind these concepts. These ideas are explored more deeply in the links below.

## Limits of Functions

When we talked about functions before, we payed attention at the values of functions at specific points. For example, the value of f(x) at x=1.

The idea behind limits is to analyze what the function is "approaching" when x "approaches" a specific value. To start getting used to this idea, let's turn to this graph:

When x approaches the value "a" in the x axis, the function f(x) approaches "L" in the y axis. In this graph I drawed a big pink hole at the point (a,L). I do this because we don't necessarily know the value of function f at x=a.

Now let's look at the graph of a function that we know:
