# Limits-and-Continuity

Let's try to understand the concepts of limits and continuity with an intuitive approach. In this page I'll introduce briefly the ideas behind these concepts. These ideas are explored more deeply in the links below.

## Limits of Functions

When we talked about functions before, we payed attention at the values of functions at specific points. For example, the value of f(x) at x=1.

The idea behind limits is to analyze what the function is "approaching" when x "approaches" a specific value. To start getting used to this idea, let's turn to this graph:

When x approaches the value "a" in the x axis, the function f(x) approaches "L" in the y axis. In this graph I drawed a big pink hole at the point (a,L). I do this because we don't necessarily know the value of function f at x=a.

Now let's look at the graph of a function that we know:

This is the function f(x) = x2. Let's pay attention to the topic (1,1). From the graph, we can see that when x approaches 1, the function f (x) approaches 1. When this happens, you understand that:

This is read "the limit as x approaches 1 of x squared equals 1".

## Why Limits are Useful

You may ask what this is useful for. A very good question. Why do you need to know what the function approaches? You already know that the function is equal to 1 when X is equal to 1, right?

For example, sometimes it doesn't really matter to us what the function at x = 1 is.

As an example of this, if we consider the following function:

Never let this notation confuse you! This means that there is something other than just x 1, which means that this function is equal to x2, and when x is equal to 1, it is equal to 0. This function is the same as we have already seen, but in this case it has a "hole" in x = 1. Let's take a look at what the graph looks like:

What do you think the function approaches when X approaches 1?  it's getting close to 1, isn't it? At this point, it doesn't matter that the function is different from 1, let's pay attention to this! That's why,

The most useful limits in calculus are similar to this. The value of the function at the specific point we care about is not defined as if it is useless, such as 0/0 (which is completely unimportant) or zero or infinite.

In these cases, we can know what the function is approaching, and this is what we really need.


## The Idea of Continuous Functions

Boundaries and continuity issues are always taken under the same subject headings in schools. This is due to the fact that they are very intertwined. The basic idea of continuity is very simple, and the "formal" definition is used as boundaries.

Basically, we are saying that a function is continuous when we can draw without separating our hand from the paper. Here is a brief example of what a continuous function looks like:

There is a precise mathematical definition of continuity that uses limits, and I'm talking about this one that is continuous functions. Intuitively, this definition mentions that small changes in the input of the function will cause small changes in the output.

If you have trouble understanding the subject, never mind! You don't need to understand and learn it all at once. The most important thing here is to recognize when you see a continuous function.

Now, what would a discontinuous function look like? A function is essentially discontinuous when there is any "gap". For example:
